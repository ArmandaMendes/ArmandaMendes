# Armanda Correia Mendes 👋

**`Software & Mobile App Developer, Content Creator, Bookworm`**

I am an up-and-coming developer currently learning Swift for iOS development. I describe myself as someone who is a natural born problem solver, a skill that was further strengthened in my current role as a Service Desk Analyst. I love learning and thus do not believe in having one sole focus and expertise. I have diversified my perspectives with initially learning Python, and then moving on to JavaScript, CSS and HTML and now have moved on the Swift, all in a spam of one year. This has allowed for me to have a dynamic skillset an also has made learning new languages easier as I am able to compare similarities and analyse differences. If I could describe myself skilfully in three words, it would be, dynamic, analytical, logical thinker.

    <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey </h3></summary>
     


As most coders will relate, I was always the “techy” in my household. I call people when they need help setting up hardware, fixing any issues related to mobile phones, laptops, or printers, or using software.
Nevertheless, I went to university to study LLB Law with honours. I graduated with 2:1. Technology has never honestly been something I had considered, mostly because it was never something I studied in school, nor was there much emphasis on it as a career path during my journey. 

But as fate would have it, the first job I landed post-graduation was a Service Desk Analyst role at the University of Westminster. Here, I was introduced to the tech industry and learned so much about problem-solving, logical and analytical thinking, and overall online research. 

It was no surprise that I naturally gravitated to this role and, because I was good at it, became a Senior member of the team within weeks!
Here is a timeline of my journey!


💻 In August 2018, got my first IT Job as a 
Service Desk Analyst. Shortly after, I became a senior member. 
Here I learned all about Windows & Mac OS, 
Hardware and Software troubleshooting, 
Research, Problem Solving, Azure, ITIL and Agile.
